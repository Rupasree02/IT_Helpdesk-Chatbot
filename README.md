# IT_Helpdesk-Chatbot
IT_Helpdesk Chatbot helps to provide IT services for the end-users. 

Wouldn't it be awesome to have an accurate estimate of how long it will take for tech support to resolve your issue? In this lab you will train a simple machine learning model for predicting helpdesk response time using BigQuery Machine Learning. You will then build a simple chatbot using Dialogflow and learn how to integrate your trained BigQuery ML model with your helpdesk chatbot. The final solution will provide an estimate of response time to users at the moment a request is generated!
