In Query editor, execute the following query and examine the data.

SELECT * FROM `helpdesk.issues` LIMIT 1000

In the next query, we will use the data fields category & resolutiontime to build a machine learning model that predicts how long it will take to resolve an issue. The model type is a simple linear regression, and the trained model will be named predict_eta_v0 in our helpdesk dataset. The query takes about 1 minute to complete.

CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `helpdesk.predict_eta_v0` 
OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg') AS
SELECT
 category,
 resolutiontime as label
FROM
  `helpdesk.issues`
  
Run the following query to evaluate the machine learning model you just created. The metrics generated by this query tell us how well the model is likely to perform.

SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `helpdesk.predict_eta_v0`)
